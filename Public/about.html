  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>As a Web Developer, I have strong skills in HTML, which is the foundation of every web page I create.
  At the time this portfolio was created, I had worked on various projects involving HTML structures and elements to build responsive and user-friendly websites.
  I understand the importance of using proper HTML tags to ensure accessibility and good SEO. With a deep understanding of HTML, I can create solid frameworks for more complex web projects.</p>

  <p>Apart from that, I also continue to hone my skills in writing clean and structured HTML code.
  At the time of creating this portfolio, I had implemented various HTML techniques to ensure web content displayed well on a variety of devices. 
  I also have experience in optimizing HTML elements to increase page load speed. With a strong foundation in HTML, I am ready to develop efficient and effective web projects.</p>

  <p>My hope is, I want to continue to develop and hone this skill, because I think programming is very fun, there is a special feeling within me when I do programming in my style.
  In the future, I have a strong desire to continue walking the path as an expert in the field of programming.</p>
