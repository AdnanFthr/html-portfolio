    <h1>Summary of Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In 21st October I was born to this world, I was the hope of a young couple at that time, and they were very grateful to have me in this world.

        Even though life is full of challenges, and failure is our path to success. But I remained enthusiastic and continued to surrender to God so that I became the person I am today. Hopefully in the future I will continue to develop into a better person, and of course be useful to the people around me.
